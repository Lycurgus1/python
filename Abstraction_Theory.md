### Abstraction
```python
def bark(self)
    return "woof"

print(fido.bark())
outcome = woof
```

### Inheritance
- Animal - from animal class inherited:
    - Attributes
    - Functionalities

- Snake inherits everything from animals class
```python
from animal import Animal
```
- animal is file, Animal is class
- Snake inherits everything from animal, animal.sleep etc

```python
def __init__(self)
    super.init()
```
- Super init refers to parent/base class

###Polymorphism
- We can inherit as well as overide
- Define methods in child class with same name as parent class
- Method overriding, overriding function in parent class or class above
- Printing numbers and string with one function(print) is an example


### Encapsulation
- Making variables or even methods private
- Hides apect of class from user
- using one "_" is convention that something should be private, but doesnt make it private
- Prevents users and developers from breaking code
```python
def __sleep()
```
