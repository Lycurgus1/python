# Calculator example
- In this the Calculator file first creates basic calculator methods.

- The more_methods file then imports and inherits these.

- The methods are then called on that file.

- They all use user input to get the numbers.
    - These are then returned to be print out for users

# DNA String parsing
The Problem
A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.
An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."
Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.
Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.
Sample Dataset:
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC

Sample Output:
