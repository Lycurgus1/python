# Instructions
- Minimum 2 methods and attributes
- Parent class into child class
- Pseudo coding

# Repositries
- Calculator example for inheritance DONE
- Historical fight club for polymorphism
    - Ibbi or georgina good example
- Abstraction exercise- always bring water
- encapsualtion cheese type


# Theory for python.
***Syntax found in individual python files***

***Python***
- Most used language
- Supports multiple systems and platforms
- Allows complexity and scaling
- Has many support libraries
- Efficient concise language

***Variables***
- What they are
    - Empty box used to store data
- Types
    - Different data types
    - Cannot add integer/float to string

```python
x + y = z
# Python puts code in box into python format
```

***Data types***
- Usual operators - (/, *, +, -, %)
- Comparators - (<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=)
- String quotes
    - Double and single work
    - But with single quotes apospthres within text become problematic  
 - Lists - stores data, uses []
 - Tuples - immutable lists, use for NINOs etc. ()
 - Dictionaries - Value and keys pairs stored together {}
 - Sets - Unordered lists, rarely used
 
 ***Functions***
 - Functions are just methods outside of class and vice versa
 - Re-iterates block of code, principles of DRY
    - Don't repeat yourself
    
 ***Classes***
 - self refers to the class
 - ```__init__``` intiliases class
 - Will need to make object for class
 - super() function refers to and gets attributes from parent class
 
 ***OOP Theory***
 
*Abstraction*
- Method (abstraction method) defined in parent class
- This then is required to mentioned in child classes, though can be overwritten
```python
def bark(self)
    return "woof"

print(fido.bark())
outcome = woof
```

*Inheritance*
- Animal - from animal class inherited:
    - Attributes
    - Functionalities

- Snake inherits everything from animals class
```python
from animal import Animal
```
- animal is file, Animal is class
- Snake inherits everything from animal, animal.sleep etc

```python
def __init__(self)
    super.init()
```
- Super init refers to parent/base class

*Polymorphism*
- We can inherit as well as overide
- Define methods in child class with same name as parent class
- Method overriding, overriding function in parent class or class above
- Printing numbers and string with one function(print) is an example


*Encapsulation*
- Making variables or even methods private
- Hides apect of class from user
- using one "_" is convention that something should be private, but doesnt make it private
- Prevents users and developers from breaking code
```python
def __sleep()
```
